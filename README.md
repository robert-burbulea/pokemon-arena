# oop-project

Design patterns I used:

Singleton: There needs to be a single arena in which the trainers play, otherwise it wouldn't make sense from a gaming perspective.

Factory: Used it for creating items

Builder: Used for creating Trainers

Strategy: used for enabling and disabling pokemon's abilities, such as attacking, dodging, spells etc.
